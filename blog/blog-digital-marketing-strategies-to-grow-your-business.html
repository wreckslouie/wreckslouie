                                        <p>I am not the first person, nor will I be the last, to tell you that digital marketing is imperative in today’s business landscape. With the continuous improvements being made to the internet and technology, not going digital is a sure-fire way to ensure that your business will be left behind, in comparison to your competitors.</p>

                                        <p class="note">&ldquo;Digital marketing is the all-mighty gateway between electronic technology and marketing psychology. Knowing how to master and manage the information going out and into this gateway can be the difference between making or breaking your business.&rdquo;  – Cory Firth</p>

                                        <p>Understanding the power of going digital is important but knowing how to implement it to your business model is critical. This can seem quite intimidating for Small Medium Enterprises (SME) but if you know the right steps, you’ll be on your way to growing your business.</p>

                                        <p>Here are five digital marketing strategies that you can use for your own business:</p>

                                        <h3>1. Goal Setting:</h3>

                                        <p>If you want to see growth in your business, set goals. When you have goals, you have a benchmark to work towards too. The power of implementing your marketing campaign on a digital platform is the ability to track and monitor results. This is the great leverage SMEs can have over bigger companies and their competitors. Data analytics will allow you to see what you’re doing right, or wrong, in order to reach your goal.</p>

                                        <h3>2. Content Creation:</h3>

                                        <p>Don’t just post something for the sake of uploading it to your website or social media sites. Create content that speaks to your target audience. Content that forces people to stop, read and want to know more about your business, product or service is good. Content is not always about your company or product but about what potential customers are looking for. Create content that answer questions the public might be asking. Not everyone will Google, &ldquo;Company ABC&rdquo;, but instead they might Google, &ldquo;Best home renovation ideas&rdquo;. Answer these questions through blog posts or forums and if your answers are compelling and informative, you’ll start building leads.</p>

                                        <h3>3. Call-to-Action:</h3>

                                        <p>This little button or link at the end of your blog, social media post or tweet is the most important aspect of the who strategy. It will mean nothing, even if you have the best article or advertisement, if the potential customer has no way to complete the experience. A call-to-action needs to be enticing. It has to offer a benefit or incentive for the user to want to click on it. Instead of having an &ldquo;Email Us&rdquo; or &ldquo;Click Here&rdquo;, change it up a little. &ldquo;Download Free Guide Now&rdquo; or &ldquo;Free Consultation&rdquo; could replace any generic call-to-action that will make the offer more desirable.</p>

                                        <h3>4. Get it Touch:</h3>

                                        <p>20 years ago, a customer who might have a complaint or feedback will have to call or mail the company they want to get in contact with. It takes time to send, the customer service team will take even longer to go through all the responses, craft an appropriate reply and send it back to you. This could take days, or weeks, that is if it even gets read and not lost somewhere along the way. Today, emails are immediate and social media replies and comments are instantaneous. This means that the customer is expecting a reply as soon as possible. Get in touch with these people in the quickest time possible. Even if you cannot give them a definitive answer to their queries, let them know that their concerns have reached you an you will get back to them in 2 or 3 working days.</p>

                                        <h3>5. Keep them Satisfied:</h3>

                                        <p>The power of today’s digital world, is the ability to continuously satisfy your customer. Even after the person has purchased a product or service from your company, you can send them ‘Thank You’ emails, future promotion emails, Newsletters and updates on the business and new products or service to look forward to in the future. By engaging with your customers, you show them how important they are to your and you’ve made their experience personal. This will make customers happy and they can become loyal to your brand, because they believe and trust you.</p>

                                        <p>Of course, there are many more strategies out there that will suit different purposes. Every business is different is understanding that is important when you craft your strategy. A strategy that works for one company might not always work for you. You’ll need to do testing and only through data analytics, understand the results and tailor something that will fit your business needs.</p>

                                        <p>If you’re looking to build a great marketing strategy for your business, and you need some help, drop by for a FREE consultation. Get in touch with us and we can discuss your opportunities over a cup of coffee, on us of course!</p>
